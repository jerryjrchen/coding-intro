# Acknowledgements

* Thanks to the course staff at [CS 61A](cs61a.org), without whom I could not have gained
  my valuable teaching experience. I have also borrowed some things from the
  curriculum.

* I used the EECS Day lab plan from [HKN](hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu) as a starting
  point for the lessons.
